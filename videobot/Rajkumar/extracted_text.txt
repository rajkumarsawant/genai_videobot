Company Use  How to fill coolant in  car 
 
Having ample engine coolant is vital to keeping your car running smoothly. You'll need 
to top up your coolant reservoir, which is found under the hood and near the engine, 
once or twice a year, otherwise your car’s internal parts may become damaged. We’ll 
show you how to do just that, as well as fill yo u in on exactly when you’ll need to add or 
replace your coolant to keep your car ship -shape.  
1. Park  your  car on a flat surface  and  let it cool  for 15 minutes. If you can, 
park on level ground to get a more accurate gauge of your coolant levels. Then, 
let the engine cool down for 15 -20 minutes.  
2. Pop  the hood  and  locate  your  coolant  reservoir. Open your car’s hood 
(often by pulling a lever by your driver’s seat) and take a look at your engine 
block to find the coolant reservoir. Often, it’s a white, semi -translucent tank near 
the engine. [2] It’s sometimes labeled with “COOLANT,” a thermometer symbol, or 
just a warning not to touch it while it’s hot.  
3. Check  your  coolant  levels  with the fill lines  on the reservoir. Most 
reservoirs have labels on the side reading “MIN,” “MAX,” or, “FILL LINE,” which 
indicate the minimum amount of coolant you should have, the maximum amount, 
or to which level you’ll fill the reservoir, respectively. Compare the amount of 
coolant in you r reservoir to these lines (the reservoir is semi -translucent for 
exactly this purpose).  
4. Remove  the reservoir  cap and add coolant  to the fill line. Unscrew or 
pop off the cap to the reservoir (make sure it’s totally cooled off, first), then, for 
easier application, place a funnel in the opening. Carefully pour  coolant  into the 
reservoir until the level reaches just below the MAX or FILL LINE. [4] Take care 
not to overfill it, which may cause damage to the reservoir.  
5.Turn  on the engine  and check  for any coolant  leaks. Let the engine run for 
about 5 minutes to let it take in new coolant. The coolant level in the reservoir may go 
down, but that’s normal. While the engine is running, examine the pipes and 
connections that lead to the reservoir, and take note of any apparent l eaks. If you spot 
dripping liquid, take your car to a mechanic sometime in the next couple weeks to have 
it professionally examined  
6. Check  your  coolant  twice  a year. If your engine is healthy and your car is 
running as usual, check your coolant once in the spring and once in the fall.  
 
7. Add coolant  if your  car is running  hot.Keep an eye on the temperature 
gauge on your dashboard, just behind the steering wheel and marked with a 
thermometer symbol. If the needle on the gauge points to red, you might either be 
lacking coolant, or your car’s cooling system may be faulty. [7] Check the reservoir to see 
if the coolant is low. If there is coolant, but your car is running hot anyway, consult a 
mechanic immediately to diagnose the problem.
